                    your credit and may result in legal action on the part of creditors or collectors for unpaid
                    balances. Consumers enrolled in debt consolidation programs who fail to adhere to the terms of their
                    debt management plan (DMP) may forfeit the benefits of debt relief and revert to the terms of their
                    original creditor agreements. Read and understand all program materials prior to enrollment. Please
                    contact a debt relief specialist for complete program details.Your debt relief analysis and savings
